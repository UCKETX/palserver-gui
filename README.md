# palserver GUI v2

Palworld dedicated server management — an agent daemon runs on the server host, a React Web UI connects to it remotely.

```
Web UI (React) ──HTTP/WS + Bearer token──▶ Agent (Node/TS, Fastify)
                                            ├─▶ native driver (default): spawns PalServer
                                            │     directly on the host, no Docker needed
                                            └─▶ docker driver (optional): PalServer containers
```

**Backends** (chosen per instance at creation):

- **native** (default) — the agent spawns `PalServer.exe` / `PalServer.sh` as a
  detached host process. It can adopt an existing dedicated-server install
  (point `serverDir` at it) or auto-install one via DepotDownloader. Survives
  agent restarts (pid-file reattach); graceful stop via the server's REST API
  when enabled, force-kill fallback. Works on any Windows/Linux box — no Docker.
- **docker** — the original container flavor, kept for Linux hosts and
  isolation-minded setups.

## Packages

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/agent` | Daemon: REST + WebSocket API, Docker orchestration (dockerode), settings → `PalWorldSettings.ini` rendering, token auth |
| `packages/web` | React + Vite Web UI: connect to any agent, instance dashboard, create/start/stop/restart, live logs |
| `packages/shared` | Shared zod schemas and API types (world settings, instance contract) |
| `images/vanilla` | Native Linux PalServer image (SteamCMD, installs/updates at boot) |
| `images/modded` | (planned) Wine/Proton flavor with UE4SS + Palguard support |

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build

# terminal 1 — agent (prints the API token on first start)
pnpm dev:agent

# terminal 2 — web UI on http://localhost:5173
pnpm dev:web
```

The agent listens on `:8250` by default and stores state in `~/.palserver-agent` (`PALSERVER_AGENT_PORT` / `PALSERVER_DATA_DIR` to override). When `packages/web/dist` exists, the agent serves the UI itself.

## Building the server image

```sh
docker build -t palserver/vanilla:latest images/vanilla
```

Instances are containers labeled `app.palserver.instance=<id>`; world saves live under `<data-dir>/instances/<id>/saved` on the host and survive container removal. Settings edits apply on the next restart.

## World settings

`packages/shared/src/options.ts` is the single source of truth: every option's
type, default, range and category (per the official docs at
docs.palworldgame.com). The zod schema, the agent's ini serializer and the web
settings editor are all derived from it — adding an option there surfaces it
end to end. Labels live in `packages/web/src/labels.ts` (zh_tw, carried over
from v1 locales).

## Developing on Apple Silicon

The real server cannot run under Rosetta (SteamCMD is 32-bit; PalServer
segfaults at world-save creation). Use the fake server for UI/agent work:

```sh
docker build -t palserver/dev-stub:latest images/dev-stub
PALSERVER_IMAGE_VANILLA=palserver/dev-stub:latest pnpm dev:agent
```

Real-server verification needs an x86_64 Linux host.

## Status / roadmap

- [x] Agent: instance CRUD, start/stop/restart, log streaming, stats, token auth
- [x] Web UI: connect → dashboard → instance detail (overview / world settings / logs)
- [x] World-settings editor: schema-driven, 80+ options, category tabs, apply-on-restart
- [x] Native backend (default): spawn/adopt host PalServer, DepotDownloader auto-install,
      pid reattach across agent restarts, REST-API graceful shutdown
- [x] Docker backend (optional): vanilla image via DepotDownloader; dev-stub image for macOS
- [x] Mods tab (native backend): one-click install/update of PalDefender
      (anti-cheat, ex-Palguard) and UE4SS from GitHub releases, Lua-mod
      enable/disable (both UE4SS layouts), pak-mod listing
- [x] File manager (native backend): browse / edit text files / upload
      (streamed, large paks ok) / delete / mkdir, confined to the instance's
      server directory; "編輯原始檔" opens PalWorldSettings.ini directly
- [x] Players tab: live metrics, player list (level/ping/coords, masked Steam
      IDs), kick, ban, broadcast, save-now — proxied through the game's REST
      API (basic auth, never exposed to the browser)
- [x] Presence tracking: the agent polls the roster every 15s and records
      join/leave events, sessions and playtime per player. The roster outlives
      logouts, so offline players stay selectable as command targets (/unban)
      and the history stays readable while the server is down.
- [x] Live map: players plotted on the game's [-1000, 1000] map square
      (constants from DT_WorldMapUIData). The world-map image is Pocketpair's
      asset, so none is bundled — supply your own via URL or upload
      (kept in localStorage).
- [x] RCON console: Source-RCON client in the agent, command palette with
      parameter forms + raw input. Built-in server commands always; when
      PalDefender is installed its RCON-capable commands are added, filtered
      by the live `/getrconcmds` list so plugin updates don't strand the UI.
- [x] Saves & backups tab: list worlds (with the active one per
      `DedicatedServerName`), switch worlds, per-player save deletion,
      tar.gz backup / restore / download, and scheduled backups (interval,
      retention, skip-when-empty). Restores take a safety backup first and
      refuse to run while the server is up. Migration guide: [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md)
- [x] Automatic restarts: scheduled (interval or times of day), sustained
      memory threshold, and crash recovery (rate-limited). Planned restarts
      warn players and save first; a manual stop is never treated as a crash.
- [x] Version check: shows the game version (REST `/info`, RCON `Info`
      fallback) on the dashboard and the instance panel, compares the
      installed depot manifest against Steam's public branch, and offers a
      one-click update (background DepotDownloader run; server must be stopped)
- [ ] Multi-host aggregation in the UI, TLS guidance, i18n (reuse v1 locales)
